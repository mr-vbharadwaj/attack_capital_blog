# Blog Platform

This is a modern blog platform built with Next.js for the frontend and Express.js with Prisma for the backend. The application allows users to create, read, and manage blog posts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- MongoDB (for the backend)
- A package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blog-platform.git
   cd blog-platform
   ```

2. **Set Up the Backend**

   - Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

   - Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure your environment variables. Hereâ€™s an example:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/yourdbname
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   - Run the database migrations using Prisma:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

   - Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

   - Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   - Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**

   Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application in action.

## Project Structure

### Frontend

- **`frontend/src/app`**: Contains the main application files, including pages and components.
  - **`page.tsx`**: The main home page that displays the latest posts and includes a search bar.
  - **`dashboard/page.tsx`**: The dashboard for authenticated users to manage their posts.
  - **`components`**: Contains reusable components like `PostList`, `PostCard`, and `PostForm`.

- **`frontend/src/lib`**: Contains utility functions and API calls.
  - **`api.ts`**: Handles API requests to the backend.

- **`frontend/src/types`**: TypeScript types used throughout the application.

### Backend

- **`backend/src/controllers`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses.
  - **`postController.ts`**: Manages post-related operations like creating and fetching posts.

- **`backend/src/routes`**: Defines the API routes for the application.
  - **`postRoutes.ts`**: Contains routes related to posts.

- **`backend/src/models`**: Defines the data models using Mongoose.
  - **`Posts.ts`**: Mongoose schema for the Post model.

- **`backend/src/index.ts`**: The entry point for the backend application, setting up the server and middleware.

### Development Choices

- **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and ease of building React applications.
- **Express.js**: Used for the backend to handle API requests and manage server-side logic.
- **Prisma**: Chosen as the ORM for database interactions, providing a type-safe and easy-to-use API for MongoDB.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling the frontend, allowing for rapid UI development with utility-first CSS.
